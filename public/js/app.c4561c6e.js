He caught on to criminals immediately, so I realized that this was a trained and highly skilled dog. Since I placed the ad under my real name I became concerned that anyone would recognize him (he has a unique star-shaped spot on his forehead) and pull a connection between Bruce Wayne and Batman. Robin had a nice solution, he cut him a mask from our black cloth toolbag and made him a bat-symbol for his collar.\\n\\nWhile I tried to use Ace to locate his master a response from the ad revealed that John Wilker, who was missing at that time, had bought his trained dog because he lives alone and is away from home all day.\\n\\nI remember those days vividly.

This was the first compact crossover SUV;[1] it made its debut in Japan and Europe in 1994,[2] and in North America in 1995. The vehicle was designed for consumers wanting a vehicle that had most of the benefits of SUVs, such as increased cargo room, higher visibility, and the option of full-time four-wheel drive, along with the maneuverability and fuel economy of a compact car. Although not all RAV4s are four-wheel-drive, RAV4 stands for \\"Recreational Activity Vehicle: 4-wheel drive\\", because the aforementioned equipment is an option in select countries.\\n\\nIn most markets, the RAV4 is the only compact SUV or crossover available from Toyota. In other markets, it is the crossover counterpart of the Toyota FJ Cruiser.\\n\\nSince the 2006 third generation model, Toyota has offered both short- and long-wheelbase versions of the RAV4. Short-wheelbase versions are sold in Japan and Europe; long-wheelbase versions in Australia and North America. Toyota of Japan also sells the longer-wheelbase version as the Toyota Vanguard, at Toyopet Store locations. Japanese versions are sold at two different Toyota Japanese dealerships, called Toyota Corolla Store and Toyota NETZ Store.","threadId":"-KvgL0BNLNz4cJhQjdP4","userId":"f5xvKdIPQdSrUtT6i3UiHYttRXO2","id":"-KvgL0BNLNz4cJhQjdP5"},{"publishedAt":1597204012,"text":"The first generation RAV4, known as the XA10 series was constructed on a unique platform that shared Carina and Corolla elements.[4] It launched in Japan in May 1994.\\n\\nThe XA10 series was offered in both three- and five-door versions.
